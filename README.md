# RNA-NMR-Decoys
Atomistic Decoy Set For RNAs in PDB that were solved using NMR, and for which NMR chemical shift data is available.
Decoys consisting of the structures in the corresponding NMR bundle, structures generated using FARFAR, and structures extracted from MD simulations
Contained in each folder are:

- coordinates/ - coordinate files of decoys in PDB format
- chemical_shifts.txt - NMR chemical shifts for each RNA
- struct.txt - structural comparison info for decoys relative to the solve NMR structures
